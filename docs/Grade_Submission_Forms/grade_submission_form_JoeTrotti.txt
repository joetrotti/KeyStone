4. One or more sentences explaining what you have done: I have taken a demo map and greatly expanded upon it. I made sure to match the enviornemt to the best of my ability 
so you dont lose the dungeon feel. I have made multiple blueprints and materials. I have also made a map for a forest that is still in the early stages. In the forest there 
is a cabin I completely made surrounded by foliage with trees and background mountains.
