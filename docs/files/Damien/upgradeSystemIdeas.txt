actually subtracting and adding to ability stats

most basic way I can think of:

everytime you change an ability go through the entire list of changes, subtract and readd what is needed

thirdpersoncharacter can have a set and reset function


more complicated: 
if previous is true and next is false then just add upgrade

if previous is true and next is 

---------
if false we want to make red after it is set to true

if true we want to make green after set to false


the setting of color is post the setting of boolean

----------

NEEDED: A function with a reference to the widget with upgradeArray to access true/false values and the index that we need to examine

to effect abilities maybe similar to how color is set 

maybe another array of type string with values such as CDR, HEALAMOUNT, and other upgrades

button 1(index 0) = cd(index 0) set cd to lower

button 2(index 1) = healamount+(index1) set healamount to higher

if we set button 1 to false we need to remove healamount+ and any other buff after

options:

option 1 remove all buffs and then go through the buff array and alter the ability until false is encountered in other array

option 2 (maybe) created a variable for saved index of highest upgrade, when you make a button false you go and remove all the upgrades from the index of the false to the index of the old highest true, and then set the highest true to the false index-1
